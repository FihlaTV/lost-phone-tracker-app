lost-phone-tracker-app
========================

Phone tracker for Android - if your phone has been stolen

Find the [release build APK here](PhoneTracker-release.apk).

Explanation
-----------
* Send text and get location back - repeatedly until an stop command is sent
* Uses the GPS location, falls back to the GSM network provider
* While the app is reporting the location, no app icon will be visible on the application launcher

To use the GPS location, an unfixed exploit is used, which seems to affect Android versions until at least 4.4.4.
You can find an explanation of the exploit at [https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7890](https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=7890).
